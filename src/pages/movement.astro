          The DC for moving through or across a hazardous space cannot be less

        <p>
          To switch choose an applicable speed to the space the creature
          occupies, and subtract the distance moved this turn. The remainder is
          how much more they can move.

          <strong>Long Jump</strong>: horizontal distance in feet equal to the
          creature's Strength score.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High Jump</strong>: vertical distance in feet equal to the
          creature's Strength score divided by 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a creature moves at least 10 feet without using an action, they can
          jump up to their long jump or high jump distance. Otherwise, they can
          only jump half that distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the jump distance exceeds the creature's remaining movement: if a
          creature is benefiting from the Jump spell, then the creature can
          still jump that distance. After landing their speed is 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          For all other forms of jumping, the creature can only jump as far as
          their remaining movement allows.

        <RuleBlock
          name="Landing on Terrain"
          description="If a jumping creature lands in difficult terrain (DC 10) or hazardous terrain (DC 15), they must succeed on an Acrobatics check to stay on their feet. Otherwise, they fall prone."

        <p>
          After falling more than 10 feet and landing on a surface, creatures
          take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen.
        </p>
        <p>
          After recieving one (or more) bludgeoning damage from falling
          creatures must make an Acrobatics check to stay on their feet, or fall
          prone. The DC is equal to the distance fallen.
        </p>
        <RuleBlock
          name="Landing in Water"
          description="If a creature falling into water does not have a reaction they are assumed to fall flat against the surface of the water and take the full damage of the fall."
        />
        <p>
          Otherwise, they can use their reaction to rotate into a safe diving
          position. When a creature dives into water, reduce the distance fallen
          by twice the depth of the body of water.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example if a creature dives 70 feet into a 20 foot deep body of
          water, calculate as (70 - (2 * 20)) and use 30 feet when calculating
          fall damage.

        />
        <p>
          Creatures without a flying speed or the aid of specific spells cannot
          fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flying creature will fall if its flying speed is reduced to 0, it is
          knocked prone, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move.
