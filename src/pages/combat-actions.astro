        <p>Choose a trigger based on a perceivable circumstance and choose a response. The response can be a single interaction, a single attack, a single spell, or movement to make.</p>
        <p>When the trigger occurs you can choose to use a reaction to perform the readied action or not.</p>
        <p>To ready a spell it must have a casting time of 1 action. Cast the
          spell on your turn and hold onto the spell’s magic and effects with
          concentration. If it is a leveled spell, you consume the spell slot during your ready action.</p> 
        <p>If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.</p>
