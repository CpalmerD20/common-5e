        <p>
          A creature is forced to make one when it is at risk from natural
          hazards or area effects. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add
          the appropriate ability modifier. Each class has proficiency in at
          least two saving throws.

          description="When a character wants to attack a target, they must roll a d20 and add proficiency and relevant modifiers. As long as the roll is not a critical miss, if the roll total equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class the hit is successful and damage must be rolled."

          Calculated as 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus. Certain armors allow

          A DC of 10 would be representative of a task a random, common adult
          may find challenging.

        <p>
          A DC of 15 is representative of a task a proficient adventurer may
          sometimes struggle with.

        <p>
          A DC of 20 is representative of a task a skilled adventurer would
          usually struggle with.
        </p>
        <p>
          A DC of 25 is for tasks that will always be challenging and may
          require the aid of fellow adventurers.

          Roll a d20 + proficiency + modifiers, equalling or exceeding the DC

        <p>
          If multiple rulings affect a roll you don't roll more than one
          additional d20.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a roll has at least one advantage and at least one disadvantage,
          The effects cancel out and one d20 is rolled.

        />
        <p>
          If a creature wears armor they do not have Armor Proficiency for they
          will be too encumbered to focus. As a result the character will have
          Disadvantage on all d20 rolls they attempt and will not be able to
          cast spells.

        <p>
          This can occur when both are trying to do the same thing and only one
          can succeed, or when one of them is trying to prevent the other from
          accomplishing a goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The participant with the higher total wins the contest. That creature
          succeeds or prevents the other one from succeeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the result is a tie, the situation remains the same as it was
          before the contest.
