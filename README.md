## The Spirit of 5e

Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition is now creative commons. Looking back I've
maintained documents to run and play the game. They are all rules-light 5e
compatible notes I've had for years.

If you're looking to have a rules document that is easier to use to run your
games. Or a document to show new players to bring them up to speed easier. Then
this is the web page you've been looking for.

To a certain degree this is homebrew, but the majority of it is rephrased
rulings to make the game more intuitive. Anything that is homebrewed is rules
like Exhaustion, where it has a lot of overhead to remember but isn't rewarding
to bring into the game.

I love that 5e is easy to pick up, the strength of 5e has always been that it
has minimal overhead. The vast majority of rule changes are to clear out parts
of the rules that could be "hand-waved" away and do not actually impact the
game. For example, versatile weapons in this document just get a +2 damage bonus
instead of changing their damage dice.
