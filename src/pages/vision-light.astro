        <p>
          To target the detected creature the character must make a DC 15
          (Survival or Investigation) check to deduce the creature's location.
          If the character fails the check, they cannot target the creature.

          If a detected creature takes damage, while it is not in darkness or
          not invisible, the creature becomes located.

        <p>
          If the detected creature is in darkness or invisible, they remain
          detected unless the attacker can see through darkness or invisibility.

          Hidden creatures can choose to reveal their location and attack
          unaware characters with Advantage, if they do the creature becomes
          located. If they attack without Advantage the creature becomes
          detected.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a hidden creature takes damage from an area effect, they will make
          noise or produce a visual disturbance, the creature becomes detected.
          Nearby characters can roll a DC 15 (Perception) check to locate the
          creature.
